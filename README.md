### Hello There! 🐱‍👤

I’m currently studying Software Engineering at CEUB University in Brasília (1st semester). At the moment, I'm focused on learning programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and C. Building a strong foundation to better understand the areas I’m passionate about.

I'm particularly interested in Software Architecture, Security Layers, and AI-powered Automation for creative tools.  
I’m also studying how to interpret software requirements and understand how systems are planned and structured.

This repository is part of my portfolio and documents my journey as I grow and evolve as a developer through academic and personal projects.
